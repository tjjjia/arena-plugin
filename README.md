#  Are.na Plugin for Obsidian

## How to use

1. Download release
2. Unpack contents to your Vault (`VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/arena-plugin/`).
3. Use a code block to include Are.na blocks or channels. Alternatively, access plugin commands through the command palette (`âŒ˜` `P` or `Control` `P`).
